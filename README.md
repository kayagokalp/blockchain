# Yet another dummy "Blockchain" 

I am implementing a dummy blockchain with rust to get better at rust and blockchain fundamentals.

## Aims
- Basic Transactions
- P2P Networking
- A basic VM implementation
- Smart Contracts

> Currently implementation of transactions, blocks, a basic mining routine are ready but main is empty, so the chain is not initiated and currently I am just working with unit tests.
